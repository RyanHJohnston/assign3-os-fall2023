To run the entire project, simply type:
./run.sh

The shell script should show everything for you.
Different outputs are located in the output.txt file as well.

If you want to use the make file, simply type:
make all

Then you can run any algorithm with the docs/ex_input.txt file:
make fifo
make sjf
make pr

Or if you want to compile directly, you can use this as an example format:
valgrind ./main.o -alg FIFO -input docs/ex_input.txt
