Line 184 on threads.c

you just finished dequeing a process in the cpu scheduler with the FIFO algorithm
what you need to do is simulate the process in the cpu scheduler in the FIFO alg
then send the process to the IO queue
make sure to get the sleep data as well
after sending to the IO queue, that's where you will process the data in said IO thread to simulate
disk IO
once the pipelines are built, that's where you start collecting data
once data is collected, write the output similar to the example output txt file

once all of this is done, you just have to write the other 3 remaining scheduling algorithms and get
the same data for all of them

the project should basically be "done" by then
just do any necessary data clean up
then finally do testing on the fox servers
